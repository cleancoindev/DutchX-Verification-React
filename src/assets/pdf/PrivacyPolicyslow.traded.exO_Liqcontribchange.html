        <li class="c8"><span class="c1 c9">Blockchain technology, also known as distributed ledger technology (or simply
                &ldquo;DLT&rdquo;), is at the core of our business. Blockchains are decentralized and made up of
                digitally recorded data in a chain of packages called &ldquo;blocks&rdquo;. The manner in which these
                blocks are linked is chronological, meaning that the data is close to impossible &nbsp;to alter once
                recorded. Since the ledger may be distributed all over the world (across several &lsquo;nodes&rsquo;
                which usually replicate the ledger) this means there is no single person making decisions or otherwise
                administering the system (such as an operator of a cloud computing system), and that there is no
                centralized place where it is located either.</span></li>
        <li class="c8"><span class="c1 c9">Accordingly, by design, a blockchain&rsquo;s records cannot be changed or
                deleted and is said to be &lsquo;immutable&rsquo;. This may affect your ability to exercise your rights
                such as your right to erasure (&lsquo;right to be forgotten&rsquo;), or your rights to object or
                restrict Processing, of your personal data. Data on the blockchain cannot be erased and cannot be
                changed. Although smart contracts may be used to revoke certain access rights, and some content may be
                made invisible to others, it is not deleted.</span></li>
        <li class="c8"><span class="c3">In certain circumstances, when interacting with the DutchX Decentralised Trading
                Protocol (the &ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c9">Protocol</span><span class="c1 c9">&rdquo;) as further
                defined in the Terms such as delivery of tokens it will be necessary to write certain personal data,
                such as your Ethereum or other cryptocurrency wallet address, onto the blockchain; this is done through
                a smart contract and requires you to execute such transactions using your wallet&rsquo;s private
                key.</span></li>
        <li class="c8"><span class="c1 c9">In most cases, the ultimate decision to (i) transact on the Ethereum
                Blockchain using your Ethereum or other cryptocurrency wallet address, as well as to (ii) share the
                public key relating to your Ethereum or other cryptocurrency wallet address with anyone (including us)
                rests with you.</span></li>
        <li class="c8"><span class="c16 c0">IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY, YOU
                SHOULD NOT TRANSACT ON BLOCKCHAINS AS CERTAIN RIGHTS MAY NOT BE FULLY AVAILABLE OR EXERCISABLE BY YOU OR
                US DUE TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE BLOCKCHAIN. THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN IS AVAILABLE TO
